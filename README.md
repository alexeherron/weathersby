# Weathersby Weather App

This web app was made using the openweather API for current weather data and the unsplash random photo API, which changes the background to a photo of the city that the user enters.

**Link to project:** [Weathersby](https://weathersby.netlify.app/)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API integration


## Optimizations

Given more time, I'd like to create a similar app that displays a video relating to the weather (rainy, sunny, snowy...) as the background.
